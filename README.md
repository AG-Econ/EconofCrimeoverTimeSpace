# Overview

This lecture+masterclass aims to give a knowhow of 1) scrape data from dynamic websites, 2) work with unstructured data. This is the readme file which gives all files/slides/codes for the talk. It also includes instrictions for getting Pycharm working.

# Datafile descriptions

Datafile 1: london_places.csv - this is a data I am providing from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London). I have done 3 modifications to it for the sake of simplicity but this should be adjusted to research objectives and equally (preferably) doable in Python. 
          a) If there are more than one postcode district for a location, I have kept the 1st one listed (one can work out the largest area etc to use the corresponding postcode district etc).
          b) If there were more than 1 location listed in each cell of locations, I added these as seperate observations in the file, with the same postcode district. 
          c) I have renamed the variable Postcode district to Postcodedistrict for convenience.
The only 2 columns of interest here for us are Location and Postcodedistrict.

Code 3: prelim_textasdata

Code 4: final_textasdata

# Declarations

I do cheat a little in this class. Pre-processing of datafile 1 should be done in Python. Some codes can be more efficient (writing loops/functions).

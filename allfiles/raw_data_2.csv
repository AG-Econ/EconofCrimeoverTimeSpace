Mr Stockdale, from Poplar, died four days later at 12.50pm on Tuesday 10 May. Detectives said he may have been targeted in a case of mistaken identity. They believe two men armed with handguns opened fire as the victim rode his bicycle down Rounton Road. The suspects, described as black or Asian and wearing face coverings, then fired a series of shots at a group outside a parade of shops in Devons Road before returning to Knapp Road to flee the scene by car. Renewing appeals for information in 2015, DI Peter Hine said: “We have always maintained that Wayne was not the intended target for this incident, which saw shots fired both at him and into the street. We are urging those who have remained silent all these years, to think about Wayne’s family and re-examine their consciences and help bring Wayne’s killers before a court.” Five men were arrested during the investigation but nobody has ever been charged.",2.0,20112.0
